<h3> 3 // PHYSICAL PATTERNS </h3>

<p> The four reference images are of natural elements found within Washington Square Park. Each of these patterns were abstracted into rectangles upon a
  different facade of a building. Each side contains a unique pattern, and forms the basis for a generative town, where patterned facades can be grouped 
  or contrasted by choice or by accident.
  
  The raw facades were run through the Pix 2 Pix facade GAN on Runway ML to produce the generated facades, after which they were mapped onto the unrolled faces
  of the various buildings.
  
  Upon assembling the pieces, you are presented a varied landscape of facades surrounding a public square. As to why the trees in this particular park are flat,
  no one knows. As to why the facades are arranged in a haphazard, yet logical manner, no one knows either. <b>GANville</b> is a place where oddities and generative acts are accepted as truths, and where walking your dog is the only law of the land.
