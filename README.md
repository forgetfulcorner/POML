<h3> 3 // PHYSICAL PATTERNS </h3>

<p> The four reference images are of natural elements found within Washington Square Park. Each of these patterns were abstracted into rectangles upon a
  different facade of a building. Each side contains a unique pattern, and forms the basis for a generative town, where patterned facades can be grouped 
  or contrasted by choice or by accident.
  
  The raw facades were run through the Pix 2 Pix facade GAN on Runway ML to produce the generated facades, after which they were mapped onto the unrolled faces
  of the various buildings.
  
  Upon assembling the pieces, you are presented a varied landscape of facades surrounding a public square. As to why the trees in this particular park are flat,
  no one knows. As to why the facades are arranged in a haphazard, yet logical manner, no one knows either. <b>GANville</b> is a place where oddities and generative acts are accepted as truths, and where walking your dog is the only law of the land.

<h3> FINAL // MRRIOR </h3>

<p>
  <b>Abstract</b>
  
This project deals with the perception of an individual by a machine learning model. It asks us to consider our own reflection and how we present ourselves to others, including machines.
  
  <b>Concept and Research</b>
  
Our identities are punctuated through our perception of self. When we look at a mirror, what do we see? Arguably, we see ourselves. What about a mirror that distorts our reflection and compresses our body? Weʼd recognize the reflection as our own, but we understand itʼs not the way we normally look. This process of seeing, perceiving, and ultimately recognizing repeats every time we come across an image or reflection in our likeness.
  
But while we might understand ourselves in this light, what might a machine see? It would depend on what the machine is looking for. One of these identifiers might be through our pose and, in turn, our actions. Another one of these might be through our physical traits, such as hair color, height, skin tone, etc. Or perhaps, the machine focuses on the silhouette of the figure standing before it.
  
These two ways of seeing and perceiving are intertwined in this project, through the act of reflecting and observing. The user faces a mirror, which bears the resemblance of the person. The mirror, which also houses the machine, as well as a camera, captures data about the person and stores it for future reference. Within this mirror, one would not only see themselves, but also constantly updating strings of text which carry the description of past “reflections,” or perceptions by the machine.
